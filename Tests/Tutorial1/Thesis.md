## Thesis

The following code snippet demonstrates how I think a game using the Vulkan2D engine
should interact with the engine in order to acheive a good balance of simplicity and flexibility. 

This is a work in progress.

```
int main(int argc, char** argv) 
{

    Scene& scene = engine::CreateScene();

    scene.add()
}
```
