# 2D Game Engine w/ Custom Physics
---

## Description
---
A 2D Game Engine written in C++ using Vulkan on the backend for rendering and ImGUI for user interface creation.

## Build
---
Currently supporting only MacOS, with windows support currently being implemented. Linux will eventually supported down the line. 

A Unix build script is included and will run CMake file that attempts to find the Vulkan SDK. All other libraries/headers came shipped with the engine. 

Simple run `./unixBuild` from the root directory followed by `build/Vulkan2D` to run the executable. 

## Motivation
---
The idea behind this project is to accumulate prior learning from other smaller projects into a fully shipped game engine.
